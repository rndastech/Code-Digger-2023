In the given submission, the code checks for a sequence of 3 same characters length wise, breadth wise or diagonally.
When the 3 non '.' characters are found (winner obtained) solve function doesn't stop searching. If any sequence of 3 '.' are found later on, it overwrites winner.
Eg:
Input:
1
...
XXX
...

Output:
DRAW

Expected Output:
X

Reason:
Row wise searching:
... => winner = '.'
XXX => winner = 'X' (code should stop searching for other winning combinations)
... => winner = '.' (winner overwritten, this is an error)

Correction:
Added bool variable 'check' in solve method, with default value 1
If a winning sequence is found (XXX or +++ or OOO), check is set to 0.
winner is overwritten only if check is set to 1.
Thus checking for combinations stop once a winner (non DRAW combination) is found.
